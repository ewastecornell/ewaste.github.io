            Countries in the Global North are illegally exporting electronic waste to countries in Africa and Southeast Asia to externalize the costs of disposal for economic gain, in what is referred to as toxic trade (BAN). Receiving nations generally lack the infrastructure to safely recycle and repurpose e-waste, contributing to human health issues and environmental degradation (Beech et al. & Yee). Further, there is a lack of transparency and visibility regarding the end-of-life cycle for electronic waste (BAN). Institutions of higher learning contribute significantly to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment e-waste, and are thus tasked with effective and equitable handling of such waste (Agamuthu et al.). As the first Ivy League institution and the 6th university in the world to reach Platinum STARS (Sustainability Tracking Assessment & Rating System) status, Cornell University is a global leader in sustainability. We believe there to be a gap in Cornell’s sustainability goals and electronics product stewardship. 
            <hr>
            Cornell’s R5 Operations collects e-waste by appointment and from a singular e-waste drop spot located outside of one of Cornell’s athletics facilities (Barton Hall). E-waste generated off-campus may not be accepted. Through this practice, 111.36 tons of e-waste were collected and shipped from campus. So far in 2023, 52 tons of e-waste have been collected and shipped to Sunnking, a secure electronics recycling facility located in Brockport, NY that responsibly handles and processes materials. There is also a month-long collection event at the Cornell Recycle Center, located about 2 miles away from campus at 251 Solidago Rd., during Cornell’s annual Beyond Waste Campaign.
            <hr>
            Cornell has already made headway in addressing the e-waste issue on campus. While these efforts should not be minimized, the magnitude of the student, faculty, and staff campus population should be taken into account when analyzing these estimates. We believe that these efforts can be strengthened with a more robust campaign with increased visibility.
