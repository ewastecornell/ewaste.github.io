            We are currently in the process of collaborating with EHS, R5 Operations, facilities management at CoE and CIS, CSO, and Student & Campus Life to create a robust network of electronics waste drop spots on campus. We are developing an app that will include a map of the secure locations where these drop spots will be positioned. On the app and stationed at each drop spot will be a list of acceptable materials. Users of the app will have the ability to opt-in to an MFA that will be used to better analyze the system and will contribute to practical recommendations that suit the evolving needs of our community.
            <hr>
            In addition to on-campus drop spots, in an effort to make e-waste recycling accessible to more Cornellians, we are working to initiate an e-waste collection service where e-waste can be collected by trained E-Steward volunteers and delivered to the Tompkins County Recycling and Materials Management (TCRMM) at 160 Commercial Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850. Electronics recycling is free and not limited by volume at TCRMM, and all e-waste is transported  to the Recycling Electronics And Computer Technologies (REACT) facility in Horseheads, NY. REACT has a C7 certification through the NYS EPA as a dismantler and recycler of used electronics. The Consolidated Checklist C7 applies to standards for the management of specific types of hazardous waste management facilities. 

            <hr>
            Considerations:
            To address the issue of security when it comes to e-waste recycling, we would modify the list of materials that are acceptable for the e-waste collection service so as not to include laptops or other equipment that could possess private or sensitive information on harddrives. Further, drivers would undergo a training module to become affiliated with the collection process. 
            <hr>
            The university could also consider registering as an Electronics Waste Collection Site to remove responsibility or liability for any data in any form stored on electronic waste surrendered for recycling or reuse (NYS DEC). Requirements for an E-Waste Collection Site include a one-time registration, annual report, controlled entry, proper storage and removal of waste, record keeping, and employee training. The E-Waste App would account for these, as there is controlled entry and surveillance into Cornell facilities listed as drop spots with E-Steward training. Participants would be responsible for reporting the amount of e-waste deposited during each drop-off, with scales stationed at each drop spot. The data collected would be stored on the app for record-keeping, and can be made available for annual reporting purposes.
            <hr>
            Project oversight could be conducted by R5 Operations in conjunction with a student project team lead.
