            <strong>            Circular economy
            </strong>
            <hr>
            E-waste recycling contributes to a Circular Economy. The practice of electronics recycling challenges the typical linear end-of-life process for technology by circulating products and material.

<strong>Material Flow Analysis</strong>
<hr>
What is it?
Material Flow Analysis allows us to track the life cycle of electronics
Inflow → Use → Outflow
<hr>
Why should I care?
You have the opportunity to contribute to a growing body of knowledge centered around electronics consumption by Cornellians and to become aware of your own consumptive patterns, allowing you to make more informed decisions about technology use and disposal.
<hr>
E-Stewards:
Electronics manufacturers share the majority of the responsibility of e-waste generation due to planned obsolescence and lack of modularity and repairability (Jackson & Kang). Cornellians, however, are in a unique position to engage with responsible e-waste recycling practices as consumers. Constituents have the opportunity to become certified E-Stewards by undergoing a training module of best practice and health & safety for asset management of e-waste.

<strong>Waste Recovery Hierarchy
</strong>
<hr>
We would also like to put out a call to action for any faculty, staff, and students/student-affiliated groups that are interested in reusing or repurposing e-waste collected by this project. The second most important phase in the waste recovery hierarchy is reuse (EPA Waste Management Hierarchy). Those seeking to maximize opportunities to reuse materials in their original form can be inspired to do so with increased accessibility to unwanted electronic materials. Designers and design researchers can grapple with the contemporary issue of material excess and impacts beyond the design moment (Dew).
