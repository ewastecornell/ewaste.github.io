            We aim to address the spatial and temporal constraints of pre-existing infrastructure at Cornell to alleviate the barriers of accessibility and awareness to e-waste recycling. While Cornell increased visibility of e-waste recycling during Electronics Recycling Month through the Beyond Waste Campaign, the Cornell Recycle Center is not accessible to all students, especially those lacking personal transportation, and students could only dispose of e-waste once a week. The current R5 Operations e-waste collection process is relatively privatized and not well communicated.
            <hr>
            In addition to increasing access to e-waste recycling, we believe that Cornell has the means to distinguish itself in pursuing greater transparency efforts as to what happens to e-waste recycled on campus to track its distribution and impact in an effort to combat agnotology. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) modeling should be conducted to investigate e-waste management systems, from asset purchase, use, end-of-life and disposal.
            <hr>
            Some logistical challenges and critical requirements of e-waste handling include security and safety, which is why we are seeking collaboration with Environmental Health & Safety (EHS), the College of Engineering (CoE) and the Bowers College of Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) facilities management, Cornell Sustainability Office (CSO), and Student & Campus life. 
            <hr>
            We acknowledge that, in addition to increasing e-waste recycling accessibility, awareness and knowledge of toxic trade and consumer responsibility needs to be integrated into campus culture. In addition to accessible e-waste recycling, we are aiming to create learning materials to be posted at various campus sites and drop-spots to increase student awareness in hopes that it will lead to greater engagement with e-waste recycling.
